## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
App Brainstorming
-Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
1. Instagram
   -Makes interaction between people easy along with its ability of sending messages snaps and unsending it.
   -Love how we can add different filters in our photos via stories
2. Kinemaster
   -Features such as adding voiceovers and subtitles along with other video editing tools
   
3. Canva
   -Love its photo editing and graphic designing compatibility.
   -How it saves time for making attractive posters or presentation which I myself use often.



Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

- Well for me I think having a feature called Memoryfavorite or something like that where we can star our messages, snaps or even audio in social medias such as instagram would be a good idea. The feature would be somehow similar to Apple Photos where we have our favorites album and we can just look at our favorite ones among the 10,000 photos which requires intense scrolling and time. Having that feature will help users to easily revisit their old messages or photos and even audios that were special to them. That's the idea which I came up with to add by myself being the user and experiencing such. Whenever you want to look back, you tend to remember the nostalgic moments but can't keep on scrolling a month ago chat so this feature would maybe create a wonderful experience.





## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The challenge I faced was when I tried to push my commits to remote origin i was getting error such as

'hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details'  

git pull was not working I needed to solve it so I tried multiple steps and $ git push -f -u origin main
 command helped me successfully commit and push my changes to my remote repo.
